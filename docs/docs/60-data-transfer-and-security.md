# Data Transfer and Security

## Data Transfer Protocols

### Overview

Container Echoes utilizes efficient data transfer protocols to ensure fast and reliable communication between the agent and the server.

### gRPC

- **Description**: gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework.
- **Usage in Container Echoes**: Ideal for its low-latency and high-throughput capabilities, gRPC is used for sending logs from the agent to the server.
- **Configuration**: Details on setting up gRPC, including any necessary certificates and endpoint configurations.

### WebSockets

- **Alternative Option**: For real-time log streaming, WebSockets may be used.
- **Benefits**: Enables a persistent connection for real-time data transmission.
- **Setup Guide**: Instructions on configuring WebSockets within the Container Echoes environment.

## Securing Communications

### TLS/SSL

- **Importance**: Encryption is crucial for securing data in transit.
- **Implementation**: Steps to set up TLS/SSL for both gRPC and WebSocket connections.
- **Certificate Management**: Guide on managing SSL certificates, including generation and renewal.

## Data Privacy and Compliance

### Data Handling Policies

- **Privacy Considerations**: Outline how Container Echoes handles sensitive log data.
- **Compliance Standards**: Information on adhering to relevant data protection regulations (like GDPR).

### Log Retention and Deletion

- **Retention Policy**: Details on the default log retention period and how to customize it.
- **Automatic Deletion**: Description of the automated process for log deletion after the retention period.

## Best Practices for Security

### Regular Updates

- **Keeping Software Updated**: Emphasizing the importance of updating Container Echoes and its dependencies for security.

### Access Control

- **User Authentication**: Implementing strong authentication mechanisms for server access.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Setting up RBAC to control user permissions and access to logs.
